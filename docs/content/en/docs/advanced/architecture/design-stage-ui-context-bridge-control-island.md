# Control Island Design Catalog

The Control Island is a floating UI component designed for the AIRI desktop environment (stage-tamagotchi). It follows an iOS-style "island" or "drawer" pattern, providing quick access to essential controls and settings.

## Component Location
- **Main Component**: `apps/stage-tamagotchi/src/renderer/components/stage-islands/controls-island/index.vue`
- **Store**: `packages/stage-ui/src/stores/settings/controls-island.ts` (Shared settings)
- **Renderer Store**: `apps/stage-tamagotchi/src/renderer/stores/controls-island.ts` (Renderer-specific state like `fadeOnHoverEnabled`)

## Layout & Interaction
- Located at the **bottom-right** of the screen.
- Collapsed by default, showing only the expand/collapse trigger and a drag handle.
- Uses `@proj-airi/electron-vueuse` for window interaction (dragging, mouse transparency, always-on-top).
- Supports "Fade on Hover" to prevent obscuring the model when handled by the user.

## Visual Design Details

- **Animations**: Uses Vue transitions with cubic-bezier easing for a premium feel.
- **Icon Set**: Primarily uses `Solar` and `Phosphor` (via Iconify).

# Adjacent Stage Components

While the Control Island is the primary interaction hub, several other "island-style" or overlay components exist within the Stage view to provide feedback and status.

## 1. Resource Status Island
- **Location**: Top-center (`top-3`).
- **Component**: `apps/stage-tamagotchi/src/renderer/components/stage-islands/resource-status-island/index.vue`
- **Purpose**: Provides a floating indicator for resource loading (models, plugins, etc.).
- **Behavior**:
    - Appears after a delay (5s-10s) if resources are still loading.
    - Shows a pulsing ring (`i-svg-spinners:pulse-ring`) during active loading.
    - Displays a "Ready!" status with a checkmark (`i-solar:check-circle-bold-duotone`) when finished.
    - Expandable: Clicking opens a detailed list of modules and their loading states.

## 2. Transcription Feedback (STT Toast)
- **Location**: Managed by `vue-sonner` (bottom-right by default, overlaying the Stage).
- **Trigger**: `apps/stage-tamagotchi/src/renderer/pages/index.vue` via `toast.info()`.
- **Purpose**: Provides immediate visual confirmation of what the user said during voice interaction.
- **Visuals**:
    - **Message**: `🎤 You said: {text}`
    - **ID**: `transcription-feedback` (prevents toast spam by updating the same entry).
    - **Style**: Matches the system toast theme but is positioned to be non-intrusive while remaining readable over the 3D/Live2D model.

## 3. Interaction Feedback (Toasts)
To provide immediate visual confirmation for Control Island actions, the following events trigger a toast in the `transcription-feedback` slot:

| Event | Toast Message |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Emotion Triggered** | `Triggered {emotion} expression` |
| **Random Emotion** | `Triggered {random_emotion} expression` |
| **Animation Cycled** | `Selected animation: {animationName}` |
| **Profile Switched** | `You selected AIRI Card: {cardName}` |

These toasts ensure the user knows their interaction was successful, even if the model's visual response is subtle.

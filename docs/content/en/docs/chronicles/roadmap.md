## Recent Changes (in `airi-rebase-scratch`)

#### 2026-04-07 - Toolchain Consolidation & Conditional Guards
- **Builtin Tools Unification**: Successfully coalesced the `mcp` tools into the main `builtinTools` registry. MCP is no longer a "sidecar" dependency; it's now part of the unified pipeline shared by Typed Chat, STT, and Proactivity.
- **Conditional Tool Guards**: Implemented a reactive guard layer for tool inclusion. The LLM is now protected from "tool-call overload" by dynamically hiding unavailable features:
  - **Artistry Guard**: `stage_widgets` and `image_journal` are omitted if Artistry is not configured.
  - **Sticker Guard**: `spawn_sticker` is hidden if the character's sticker library is empty.
  - **MCP Guard**: MCP tools are only registered if at least one MCP server is configured in the system.
- **Legacy Store Cleanup**: Stripped manual tool injection logic from `llm` and `live-session` stores, significantly reducing technical debt and ensuring consistent behavior across all interaction surfaces.

#### 2026-04-05 - Caption Continuity & Hardware-Level Resets
- **Hardware-Level Turn Reset**: Implemented a definitive solution for caption "blob" accumulation. Both the sender (`Stage.vue`) and receiver (`caption.vue`) now listen directly to the `airi-chat-stream` broadcast; the moment a new user message is detected, both the internal string accumulator and the overlay display are wiped clean.
- **AI-Only Caption Guard**: Hardened the codebase with explicit "Ninja Guard" comments to forbid the inclusion of user speech in the caption overlay, preserving it as a pure AI-only context tool.
- **Receiver Debug Logging**: Added persistent `console.log` state to the caption renderer to allow real-time verification of incoming broadcast events and reset signals.

#### 2026-04-04 - Live2D Expression Mapping & UI Refined
- **Live2D Settings Revamp**: Reorganized the Live2D settings into a standardized 3-panel architecture (Character, Scene, Advanced) to match the premium VRM experience.
- **ACT Emotion Mapping**: Implemented a "hold to map" system for Live2D expressions. Users can now long-press any expression button to bind it to a standard ACT emotion (Happy, Sad, etc.).
- **Stable Baseline Manager**: Developed a robust transient emotion system for Live2D with "flush-on-trigger" logic, preventing stuck expressions during rapid interaction or "stress testing".
- **UI Spacing Optimization**: Added a `compact` mode to the `SelectTab` primitive and shortened Live2D tab labels to ensure 100% visibility in the narrow sidebar.
- **Universal Speech Transformer (New)**: Implemented a hardened middleware layer for TTS synthesis that cleans narrative markers, strips emojis/kaomojis, and handles configurable tilde substitutions (e.g. "nyan"). This significantly improves vocal clarity by removing visual-only "junk" from the spoken input.

#### 2026-04-04 - Control Island UX & Modular Artistry
- **Model Selector Stability**: Fixed a regression where character card updates (e.g. from proactivity heartbeats) would force-reset the renderer's model while the user was in the Model Selector.
- **Control Island Mutual Exclusion**: Refactored the UI to ensure the Main island and Gemini/Module islands auto-collapse each other, preventing desktop clutter.
- **Gemini Control Island UX**: Implemented specialized auto-hide logic (Action vs. Cycle) and disabled legacy settings buttons to match the premium Main island experience.
- **Native Performance (Koffi)**: Migrated the proactivity sensor pipeline to Koffi for Win32 FFI, achieving sub-1s telemetry heartbeat ticks (optimized from ~1.5s).
- **Context-Width Inheritance**: Implemented a global `localStorage` map for model-specific context defaults. Characters now automatically inherit their token limit from this map if not explicitly set.
- **Artistry Module Controls**: Added a global "None" provider and per-character disable switches.
- **Dynamic Prompt Stripping**: Implemented logic to automatically strip image-generation instructions from the system prompt whenever Artistry is disabled.

#### 2026-04-02 - Performance Stability & Provider Expansion
- **Performance Regression Fix (Windows)**: Successfully identified and reverted the Async PBO rendering implementation to the robust synchronous fallback. This resolved the "App Not Responding" and mouse jitter issues reported on Windows.
- **Proactivity Memoization**: Optimized the `proactivity` store by memoizing usage metrics (TTS/STT/Chat counts). Heavy filtering logic is now throttled to the 10s sensor tick instead of running on every reactive update.
- **AWS Polly Native Integration**: Implemented direct neural speech synthesis using `aws4fetch` for secure V4 signing, bypassing local proxies and supporting dynamic region-based voice discovery.
- **MCP Management Dashboard**: Launched the premium Antigravity-inspired hub for Model Context Protocol servers. Includes curated discovery, tool titration (per-tool toggles), and real-time status counts.
- **Localization Rollout (Z.ai & Azure)**: Completed professional marketing copy and backfilled missing titles for 9 locales.

#### 2026-03-31 - Research: Standalone Sticker System & Multi-Window Widgets
- **Multi-Window Widget Architecture**: Successfully refactored the `WidgetsWindowManager` to support spawning multiple, independent Electron windows instead of a single reusable panel. Each standalone widget now gets its own window lifecycle.
- **Strict Sticker Transparency**: Implemented a specialized window configuration for stickers that disables "Acrylic" vibrancy to ensure perfect transparency.
- **Adhesive Sticker Spawning**: Integrated a "Standalone" toggle in the Sticker Library to trigger independent widget spawning with 60s auto-decay and manual dismissal.
- **ScrollLock State Opt-out**: Disabled the renderer-side mic-state syncing to prevent unwanted ScrollLock LED flickering on Windows.

#### 2026-03-30 - Kawaii Sticker System & Context Awareness Refinement
- **Dynamic System Prompt Synchronization**: Implemented a hot-swapping mechanism that automatically updates the active chat's system message when character settings (persona, traits, description) change. No chat reset required.
- **Character-Scoped Sticker Library**: Re-engineered the sticker system to isolate libraries per character. Implemented a fresh `library-v2` store to ensure strict data separation.
- **Sticker Hallucination Suppression**: Hardened the AI context prompt with CRITICAL instructions and implemented direct tool-call error feedback to prevent the LLM from hallucinating unavailable stickers.
- **Kawaii Sticker System UI**: Added "Clear Library" functionality for scoped deletion and renamed "Clear All" to "Clear Screen" for functional clarity.
- **Sticker Asset Cleanup**: Batch-processed the `Project-Mint-2` sticker set to normalize filenames, strip timestamps, and promote high-quality base assets.
- **Kawaii Sticker System ("Full Gusto")**: Initial implementation of the persistent sticker system with viewport-wide "wild" randomized spawning. Includes an automated 60s cleanup loop for both AI and manual placements.
- **Sticker Awareness**: Integrated a new context provider that keeps AIRI aware of what stickers are currently decorating her screen.
- **Visual State Awareness (Expressions)**: Developed the `Expressions` context provider, allowing the AI to "see" its own active expressions and props (e.g., blushing, glasses, cat ears) in both VRM and Live2D.
- **Intelligent Scene Filtering**: Refined the `Scenes` context provider to strictly filter for environmental backgrounds, preventing roleplay confusion from selfies or journal images.
- **Vue Template Fixes**: Resolved literal mustache tag parsing errors in `HackerPanel.vue` using `v-pre`.

#### 2026-03-29 - Onboarding Overhaul, Modular Wardrobe & Interface Revamp
- **Integrated Profile Switcher**: Redesigned the Character Profile Picker in the Control Island. Replaced the popover UI with an integrated sub-menu, adding utility buttons for Gallery and Profile Management. This resolves layout issues on small windows.
- **Sense Portal (Easy Mode)**: Implemented a streamlined, zero-config onboarding path using **OpenRouter** and **Deepgram**.
- **Onboarding Orchestration**: Developed a modular multi-step setup flow with branching paths (Easy vs. Advanced) and automatic provider/model initialization.
- **Polymorphic UI Components**: Enhanced the core `Button` primitive to support polymorphism, enabling seamless integration of external setup links.
- **Modular Wardrobe Architecture**: Implemented a schema-driven wardrobe system that persists outfit bundles (base vs. overlay) within the AIRI character card.
- **Interactive Build Mode**: Created a real-time staging area for outfits with state snapshotting/restoration, allowing users to preview complex expression combinations before saving.
- **Control Island Integration**: Integrated live wardrobe data into the desktop island hub with visual feedback for active base and overlay layers.
- **Character Photo Mode**: Implemented a standalone, countdown-based (3-2-1) capture mode in the Control Island. Generates high-quality composite PNGs of the character + active background with an interactive camera flash effect.
- **Selfie-Enhanced Previews**: Character cards in settings now dynamically display the latest captured 'selfie' as the preview portrait.
- **Smart Viewfinder & Framing**: Added a 16:9 dashed-border viewfinder during countdown and shifted the card preview to a **15% top-offset** for optimal character headroom.
- **Gallery Download Support**: Added direct "Download" functionality to character-scoped image journals.
- **Icon Standardisation**: Updated expressions and profile icons for better distinctness and accessibility.

#### 2026-03-28 - Neural Memory & Interface Refinement

#### 2026-03-27 - Reload Accountability & Asset Autonomy

- **Reload Accountability (Stage UI)**: Implemented tracking and display of "reload reasons" (e.g., manual selection, initial load) in the loading overlay to improve observability of redundant scene resets.
- **Journal Background Awareness**: Successfully implemented proactivity sensor awareness of the active stage background chosen from the `image_journal`.
- **CUIPP Standalone Extraction**: Transitioned the bridge into a clean standalone generation worker architecture.
- **Agentic Asset Creation (Stage/Widgets)**: AIRI can now proactively generate her own stage backgrounds and widget images.
- **Scenic Background Starter Pack**: Integrated the initial collection of default scenic backgrounds.
- **Image Journal Integration**: Successfully implemented the `image_journal` as a first-class tool and persistent UI component, replacing ephemeral widget-based generation.

### 2026-03-20 - Memory Milestone: Short-Term + Long-Term Foundations
- **Short-Term Memory Rebuild Prototype**: Implemented per-character rebuild-from-history that groups chat logs by local day, generates one summary block per day, stores those blocks durably, and injects recent blocks into new/reset sessions for continuity.
- **Long-Term Memory / `text_journal`**: Implemented a first-class append-only journal tool with:
  - `create`
  - `search`
  - Both are scoped to the active character and backed by IndexedDB-style local storage.
- **Real Long-Term Memory UI**: Replaced the mock long-term memory page with a real archive view that reads stored entries, supports per-character filtering, and supports keyword search.
- **Toolchain Alignment Across Pipelines**: Confirmed and documented that typed chat, STT-triggered chat, and proactivity in Tamagotchi now all consume the shared `builtinTools` surface, so new builtin tools like `text_journal` do not need to be manually re-wired into each pipeline.
- **Chat Presentation Polish for Journal Writes**: Added a custom presentation layer for `text_journal` create calls so journal saves render as a formatted memory card in chat rather than raw JSON tool arguments.

### 2026-03-17 - Live2D Fixes, Churn Suppression & Tool-Aware Proactivity
- **Live2D 206 Fix**: Resolved critical `206 Partial Content` loading failure in `opfs-loader.ts` by normalizing responses into full `200` blobs.
- **Character Switcher Churn Fix**: Implemented **Identity Guards** in `index.vue` and the `airi-card` store. Redundant model reloads and "You selected..." toasts are now suppressed when character metadata updates without an actual model switch.
- **Improved Refresh Logic**: The Control Island's refresh button now triggers a **Forced Model Reload** via the store, allowing model resets without a full window reload.
- **Proactivity Tool Registration**: Implemented a dynamic tool registration system for the Heartbeats pipeline. The AI can now fetch and use contextually relevant tools (Volume, Time, etc.) during proactive evaluation.
- **DeepSeek/GLM-4.7 Support**: Added streaming support for `reasoning-delta` events and hardened the categorizer against malformed tag typos to prevent prompt stalls.
- **Selective Upstream Sync Audit**: Completed a thorough comparison against the March 15th upstream baseline (`65faf3f`). Confirmed upstream is primarily churn; integrated functional message-flattening logic into the fork.
- **System Volume Sensor**: Integrated a PowerShell-backed sensor for real-time volume levels in the proactivity payload.
- **Hotkey Persistence**: Fixed race condition where microphone toggle (e.g., Caps Lock) would reset to Scroll Lock.

### Prior Improvements
- **Dynamic AIRI Card Exports**: Session-aware snapshot system capturing outfits and expressions in real-time.
- **Expanded VRM Animation Library**: Increased library to 24 type-safe presets with standardized English naming.
- **Artistry System Refactor**: Moved configuration to character card settings with automated widget prompt injection.
- **Manual (Pure Mic) Mode**: Bypasses VAD for pure manual microphone triggering.
- **Heartbeats System (Proactivity)**: Restored proactivity UI and sensor-backed payload previews.

## Pending Items (Roadmap)
- **Artistry & Proactivity Refinement**:
    - [x] **Artistry Character Toggle**: Allow users to fully disable artistry features on a per-character basis, which will dynamically update the character's system prompt builder to omit relevant image-generation instructions and tool definitions. [x]
    - [x] **Artistry Global "None" Provider**: Implement a \"none\" state at the global provider level to allow disabling image generation across the entire app, regardless of individual character settings. [x]
    - [ ] **Proactivity Pipeline Overhaul**: Revisit the end-to-end proactivity pipeline focusing on three key tenets:
        - [Testing Phase] **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Implementation of native win32 sensors (Koffi) is complete; currently verifying performance and parity on macOS and Linux (e.g., volume/idle sensors) to ensure robust performance across all desktop environments.
        - [x] **Performance Optimization**: Minimize main-thread blocking and resource consumption during sensor polling and evaluation ticks. [x]
        - **Context Parity**: Ensure the proactivity engine receives the same high-fidelity context payload (same sensors, tool definitions, and history) as the standard chat pipeline to prevent inconsistent reasoning or a \"brain-split\" where the AI thinks it has access to sensors/tools that are actually missing or broken.

- **Speech Experience & Transformation**:
    - [x] **Universal Speech Transformer**: Develop a lightweight middleware for the Speech Module to clean/transform text before TTS synthesis. [x]
        - [x] **Narrative Logic**: Mute or Flatten asterisks and parentheses. [x]
        - [x] **Visual Cleanup**: Strip emojis and Kaomojis (Hardened). [x]
        - [x] **Tilde Handling**: Substitution strings for phrases like "nyan". [x]
        - [x] **Cost Optimization**: Alphanumeric guard and URL/Markdown stripping. [x]
        - [x] **UI Location**: Integrated into the left column of the Speech Settings Module. [x]
        - [x] **Spec**: See [docs/blueprint-tts-universal-speech-transformer.md](docs/blueprint-tts-universal-speech-transformer.md). [x]

- **Character Outfit & Habitat Management**:
    - [ ] **Live2D Outfit System**: Port and enable the modular wardrobe/outfit system for Live2D models.
    - [ ] **Outfit Context**: Integrate available and active outfit labels into the Chat Context Manager.
    - [ ] **Permanent Outfit Changes (`change_outfit` tool)**: Implement a polymorphic tool for the AI to perform non-ephemeral swaps, supporting mutually exclusive swaps and additive layer/accessory controls. (Blocked until Live2D outfit system is ready).
- **Browser-Integrated Card Imports (Phase 2)**: (Next Focus) Deep integration with external character sites via an in-app Electron browser. Hooks for direct importing while respecting site ads/iframes.
- **Vision Feature Integration**:
  - [/] **Gemini 2.5 vs 3.1 Support**: Implement support for both versions to compare the "richer" experience of 2.5 vs the standard 3.1 implementation. [/]
- **Unified Multi-Platform Service Revamp**:
  - [ ] **Cross-Platform Service Layer**: Transition the messaging/bot integration from platform-specific standalone processes (Discord, Telegram, etc.) into a unified, abstract service layer within AIRI.
  - [ ] **Unified Protocol Handlers**: Implement a standardized interface for common actions (e.g., character switching, manual emotion triggering, proactive heartbeat routing, and inline Artistry) that can be shared across all messaging platforms (Discord, Telegram, etc.).
  - [ ] **Heuristic Routing Engine**: Develop a central engine to determine the last active channel across all connected platforms to intelligently route proactive turns.
  - [ ] **Full Revamp Spec**: See [docs/feat__discord-revamp.md](docs/feat__discord-revamp.md) for the initial technical roadmap, which serves as the blueprint for the wider multi-platform rollout (including Telegram).

- **Infrastructure & UI Health**:
    - [ ] **Settings - System Revamp**: Completely overhaul the `settings > system` page to resolve the current "hodge-podge" of disjointed, nested, and potentially duplicated settings:
        - **Consolidation**: Pivot away from deep nesting and instead group related settings on a single, well-organized page with clear section headers.
        - **Developer Mode Relegation**: Move developer-specific tools and configuration out of the main system flow to prevent clutter for standard users.
        - **Deduplication Audit**: Conduct a full audit to identify and merge settings that are currently duplicated across different pages (e.g., speech or consciousness settings appearing in multiple places).
        - **Emphasis on Discoverability**: Focus on a flatter hierarchy where most critical system options are accessible without multiple layers of navigation.
    - [ ] **Context-Width Global Mapping**: Implement a global storage map (local storage) that links `providerId` and `modelName` to a user-defined `contextWidth`.
    - [ ] **Generation Tab Persistence**: Update the generation settings tab to automatically update this global map when a value greater than 0 is set.
    - [ ] **Context-Width Inheritance**: Refine the chatbox loading-bar logic to coalesce settings: if a character's context width is unset, it should inherit the value from the global map matching the active provider/model pair.
    - [ ] **Control Island Mutual Exclusion**: Refactor the Control Islands (Main and Gemini/Module-specific) to ensure only one can be open at a time; opening one should automatically close any other open island.
    - [ ] **Gemini Control Island Auto-Hide Logic**: Update the button behaviors in the Gemini/Module Control Island to match the "Main" island's established UX:
        - **Toggle buttons** (e.g., Grounding toggle, Voice/Custom mode toggle) should trigger an auto-hide of the island panel.
        - **Cycle buttons** (e.g., Interval cycling) should keep the island panel open for further interaction.
    - [ ] **Status Indicator Audit**: Revisit `settings>modules` and `settings>providers` to ensure the "green state" (connected/enabled) indicators are working accurately for all entries.
    - [ ] **Gemini Control Island Onboarding Modal**: Implement a one-time "What is this?" premium dialog for the Gemini island:
        - **Content**: Bullet points covering multimodal capabilities (image/text/voice), Google Live's session-wide overrides (LLM/TTS/STT), and manual camera triggering via the viewfinder icon.
        - **Persistence**: Once dismissed, mark a `localStorage` key as "seen" to prevent re-showing until copy or keyname changes.
        - **Trigger**: Automatically prompt the user the first time they open the island after configuring their API key.
    - [ ] **Model Selector Stability (Research & Design)**: Investigate and resolve the "reactive reset" bug where selecting a temporary preview model in the Model Selector is overridden by the active character's stored model configuration:
        - **Problem**: Users on character "Mint" (set to `mint123.vrm`) select `mint456.vrm` in the Model Selector for a temporary preview; reactive logic currently forces a reset back to `mint123.vrm` after a few moments.
        - **Proposed Solution**: Detect when the user is in the Model Selector route/page and suppress the character-scoped model restoration logic.
        - **UI Enhancement**: If the active character's model configuration differs from the current Model Selector preview, display a non-intrusive warning: *"Your model will be restored to the one set on your character once you leave this page unless you click Apply Now."*
        - **Current Workaround (Kludgy)**: Users are currently forced to "Set model to {character}" just to avoid a reset, even if they aren't ready to commit to the change.
- [x] **Privacy Indicator**: Add visual feedback in Controls Island when AIRI is "Watching". [x]
### 🛠️ HUD & HUD-Bridge Improvements
- [ ] **Fix**: Caption toggle in Controls Island fails to disable the panel (System Tray workaround only).
- [ ] **Refactor**: Extend `image_journal` tool with `mode: "bg" | "widget" | "inline"` and `selfie: any` (boolean or expression).
  - `bg`: Direct to background.
  - `widget`: Open in standalone window.
  - `inline`: Route to chat message.
- [ ] **Character Photo Mode**: Trigger 3-2-1 countdown selfie natively via `image_journal(selfie: true)`.

- [ ] **Caption System Overhaul**: Address critical usability issues with the current caption implementation:
    - **Alignment Stability**: Fix "alignment loss" where captions fail to follow their intended target.
    - **Font Customization**: Add controls for adjusting font size.
    - **Background Controls**: Add background color and transparency/opacity settings.
    - **State Persistence**: Ensure caption settings (enabled/disabled) persist across process restarts.
- **[Experimental] Widget-Native Transient Chat Bubbles**:
  - Context-aware, at-a-glance chat history overlaid directly on the transparent `Stage.vue` model layer.
  - Typed queries from Whisperdock push directly to the Stage as right-aligned bubbles, with the AI's response cascading below it.
  - Maintains only the active context (last 2-3 turns) so the model isn't obscured. Designed optimally for characters tuned for short, conversational responses.
  - Frosted glass aesthetics to blend seamlessly with the desktop background and model canvas.
  - Focuses on TTS audio delivery; text is aggressively truncated to save space, but expands to reveal the full response upon click/hover if the user missed the audio cue.

## Defunct / Scrapped Ideas
- **Live2D ZIP Repackaging**: Intercepting oversized ZIP imports on the Electron side (Scrapped; focus shifted to asset autonomy).
- **Onboarding Overhaul (Phase 1)**: (Completed via Sense Portal / Easy Mode).
- **Modular Wardrobe System**: (Completed).
- **Integrated Profile Switcher**: (Completed).
- **Character Photo Mode**: (Completed).
- **MCP Management UI**: (Completed).
